This was my first attempt at using javascript for a website.

While doing a course at Scrimba, this was my first challenge using javascript. The challenge consisted of creating a people counter using html, css and javascript only.

The html and javascript I used were based on what I learned on the course, the css I changed to fit my bird themed website (cause I love my birdies 🐦🐦🐦).

# Bonus

This wasn't a requirement, but I challenged myself to make it useable on mobile too.

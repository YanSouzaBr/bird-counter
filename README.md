# bird-counter
This was my first attempt at doing a website using javascript. I stylized the website myself.

While doing a course at Scrimba, our first JavaScript challenge was to create a people counter. I decided to do a 🐦 bird 🐦 counter instead (because i love birds).


This wasn't a requirement, but i wanted to challenge myself to make it look good on mobile too.
